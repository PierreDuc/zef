ZEF Assignment
---------------

You should have been tasked by ZEF to do either the 1) Coding Assignment *OR* 2) Design Assignment *OR* 3) Advanced Assignment so there is no need to make all!

### 1) Coding Assignment

Make an application that implements the functionality of the given design. You can implement the UI with material components that resembles the components in the design, i.e. the visual appearance does not need to match the design just the functionality and general layout. For the interaction parts that are not clearly visible in the design use your own imagination about how the checkout process should work. We don't expect fully implemented application only the basic functionality that forms the basic checkout process visible in the design, but its up to you how far you take the assignment.

##### Design for the app:

  https://projects.invisionapp.com/d/main#/projects/prototypes/10303166

  You should have invitation in your email to set up a free account to invision.

##### Steps to get started:

  - Fork the repository to your own GitHub account.

    Make a Pull Request when you are done with the assignment and want to return your work.

  - Setup your development environment by running: npm install

    After that you should be able to get live preview with: npm start

  - Setup your code editor to use stylelint and tslint plugins.

  - Implement the app into app.component.html and app.component.scss.

    You can naturally generate more components and even use the router, but one component implementation is enough.

  - For the layout use the attributes provided by flex-layout library (fxLayout, fxFlex etc.).

    You can use the breakpoints provided by the library (xs,sm,lg,...) instead of the breakpoints mentioned in the designs.

    More info about the flex-layout library and its usage:

    https://github.com/angular/flex-layout

  - Use material library components always when possible instead of pure HTML elements (input, button).

    More info about the material library components and their usage:

    https://material.angular.io/

  - The application does not need to look exactly like the design, but it should have similar concept / layout / elements and provide the functionality of the checkout process. You can use the ngIf and click events to change between views if such things are needed (example provided in the code) or if you are more familiar with Angular project then you can use even the router and separate components for separate views etc.

  - Try to follow the coding guidelines and best practices that are mentioned in the README file. If you have setup your code editor correctly it should use the tslint.json and stylelint.json configuration file and provide
    coding style errors etc. for you.

### 2) Design Assignment

Make an application that replicates the given design visually as closely as possible. For margins / paddings / etc. that are not defined in the design you can use your own estimation. Try to make the styles generic, i.e. don't style each element individually, instead style each widget / element with using generic classes. Use variables for max width and other layout related sizes for easy changing (Only the main layout parts, don't make everything like all the paddings and margins as variables).

Fork the repository to get started and to return the assignment make a Pull Request.

##### Design to replicate:

  - Setup your code editor to use stylelint and tslint plugins.

  - Implement the design into app.component.html and app.component.scss.

    You can naturally generate more components and use the typescript files as well, but one component implementation is enough.

  - For the layout use the attributes provided by flex-layout library (fxLayout, fxFlex etc.).

  - Use material library components always when possible instead of pure HTML elements (input, button).

  - The application does not need to have any real functionality, i.e. the plain UI implementation is enough. You can use the ngIf and click events to change between views if such things are needed (example provided in the code). Or if you are more familiar with Angular project then you can use even the router and separate components for separate views etc.

  - Try to follow the coding guidelines and best practices that are mentioned in the README file. If you have setup your code editor correctly it should use the tslint.json and stylelint.json configuration file and provide coding style errors etc. for you.

### 3) Advanced Assignment

Make an application that implements the functionality of the given design. You can implement the UI with material components that resembles the components in the design, i.e. the visual appearance does not need to match the design just the functionality and general layout. 

The application you are implementing is a PowerPoint like slide view with side panel controls. There can be slide groups and individual slides. Focus on the efficiency of the implementation and not the looks. The larger amount of slides and the more complex editing view it could handle the better.

##### Design for the app:

  Check the [design-1.png](https://github.com/zefoy/zef-assignment/blob/master/design-1.png), [design-2.png](https://github.com/zefoy/zef-assignment/blob/master/design-2.png) and [design-3.png](https://github.com/zefoy/zef-assignment/blob/master/design-3.png) images in the root of this repository.

  Notice that the slides are called as questions in the designs, but you can call them what you like in your implementation.

##### Minimum requirements:

  The data format needs to be as in the example data provided in the [data.json](https://github.com/zefoy/zef-assignment/blob/master/data.json) file which is also in the root of this repository.

  The left side panel needs to be controlled by the router url / tabs (Only the build tab needs to have content, others can be empty).

  The right side edit area needs to be the same for all the tabs (So route only changes the left panel content and the right side stays as it is).

  Slides on the right editing view needs to be swipeable/scrollable with possibility to edit the slide title (You need to use ngx-swiper-wrapper library for the right view).

  Slide can be selected either from the left panel or from the right Swiper area, and both the panel and Swiper needs to reflect the active slide (i.e. the slide in the view on the right).

  The selecteds slide key needs to be as route parameter so that the active slide will stay active on page reload or when link is copied and opened in another browser tab.

  The last slide of each slide group needs to be slide with add to group action and the very last slide needs to be add new slide.

##### Optional functionality:

  Add re-arranging of the slides in the left panel with DND (You can use ng2-dragula library or some other library of your choice).

  Add adding of slides in between of the slides in a way that if user hovers mouse in between the items on left panel an add slide item / group action would appear.
